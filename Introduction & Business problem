The London underground system is the oldest underground metro in the world. 
It consists of 11 lines linking 270 stations. 
In 2017/18 it carried nearly 1.4 billion passengers

For my Capstone project, I will be looking into the neighbourhoods that each station is found in. 
By analyzing the venues surrounding each station I will be able to group them and also determine 
what is their primary usage, whether they serve an area which is mostly residential, office, 
commercial based etc.

This analysis would be useful to TfL (Transport for London) and local government for town planning 
purposes. It will show what the system is being used for, how people travel from home to work or 
entertainment, and where expansion of the network may be required.
