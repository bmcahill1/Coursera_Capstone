The data I will require to execute this project will include:

1.	The geo locations of each of the stations on the network (which I will scrape from Wikipedia)
2.	The Foursquare dataset which I will access to ascertain the primary venue types surrounding each station
    This could be 'residential', or 'education', or 'bars & restaurants' etc.

Based on the primary venue types surrounding each station I will do a cluster analysis to identify groups of 
stations and then look at what these groups have in common / what differentiates them from other groups.
