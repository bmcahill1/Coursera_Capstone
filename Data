The data I will require to execute this project will include:

1.	The geo locations of each of the stations on the network (which I will scrape from Wikipedia)
    From this I will be able to extract the latitude and logitude of each of the stations which will allow
    me to plot them on a map and to find the venues near to their location.
    
2.	The Foursquare dataset which I will access to ascertain the primary venue types surrounding each station
    This could be 'residential', or 'education', or 'bars & restaurants' etc. I will pass the Foursquare API
    the latitude and longitude coordinates for each underground station and it will return to me the varieties
    of venue in the surrounding area.

Based on the primary venue types surrounding each station I will be able to do a cluster analysis to identify groups of 
stations and examine what these groups have in common / what differentiates them from other groups.
